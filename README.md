## Web Boilerplate

This is some fairly simple boilerplate code that will save me about 30 Minutes for each project.

### Gulp

There are three gulp tasks included:
- browser-sync (starts a BrowserSync server)
- js (Minifies and concatinates JS files)
- scss (Compiles SCSS to CSS, autoprefixes and minfies it)

Before you can run those, make you to install all neccessary npm packages with the following command:

    npm install
